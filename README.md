## ✨ With this version:  
- The **folder structure** is detailed with **icons & categories**.  
- It has **sections for usage, features, contributions, and future plans** → looks more professional.  
- You can copy-paste directly into your `README.md` file.
  
Would you like me to also **create a sample set of prompts** (with realistic text in `.txt`/`.md`) and **placeholder images** so your repo doesn’t look empty when you first push it?
